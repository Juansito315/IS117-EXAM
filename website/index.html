<p class="bold">Hello my name is Juan Rojas. I was born in Cali, Colombia. I am pursuing a career in Networking Administration and Security. I enjoy being around nature. I am also a very charitable person that likes to see others succeed. I always enjoy being around computers, I spend most of my time surfing the internet; reading and learning new things. I also like to work-out to stay healthy and get out of the day-to-day routine. I am very quiet and shy but easy to talk to. I also speak Romanian and Spanish.</p>
<p class="bold">Since I was 8 years old; when I had my first encounter with a computer I always knew my passion and drive for some career in a technical field. I am a self-taught Delphi/C++ programmer and Pawn. I’m also into web-design as a hobby. I came to NJIT because my cousins graduated from here and because for an IT career this was my best choice.</p>
